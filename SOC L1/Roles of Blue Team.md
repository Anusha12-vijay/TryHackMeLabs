Soc role in blue team:
Security Hierarchy
Cyber security priorities are different for every company. For law firms, the goal is the privacy of the legal documents. For factories, the availability of production lines. For hospitals, patient safety. That's why every company has a unique security approach and security team structure. Let's take a look at the high-level example of it:

A diagram of security leadership: Technical employees like SOC analysts have a department manager who reports to CISO and ultimately to CEO.

Looking at the diagram above, top executives like the CEO usually focus on global business objectives and don't manage technical aspects. That's why they hire a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or a similar role who knows the business needs and can create the most suitable security departments.

Security Departments
In tiny companies, the IT department takes the role of securing the company. Small to medium-sized companies may have a generic "Information Security" team that does all sorts of tasks. For this room, we will focus on bigger companies with a CISO overseeing multiple security teams, each handling a specific task. For example:

Red Team: Offensive security experts, pentesters, or ethical hackers who look for security issues
GRC Team: Specialists managing policies and ensuring compliance with regulations like PCI DSS
Blue Team: Defensive security experts like SOC analysts, engineers, or incident responders
Blue Team is about defensive security, meaning it constantly monitors for attacks and tries to respond to them quickly. Depending on a company's size and sector, Blue Team can include a lot of different roles and subdepartments, usually counting 3 to 50 members total. Now, let's explore the most common Blue Team departments.

Security Operations Center (SOC)
The SOC team is comprised of L1 and L2 analysts, engineers, and a manager. The team investigates the alerts, cooperates with IT, and creates detection rules.

That's where you are most likely to start your cyber security journey! SOC is the central hub for an organization's cyber security - they are the first line of defense, work with various alerts, and handle most attacks. You can read more about SOC structure in this room, but an efficient SOC is usually composed of the following roles:

L1 Analysts: Junior members who triage alerts and pass complex cases to L2
L2 Analysts: Experienced members who investigate more advanced attacks
Engineers: Experts in configuring security tools like EDR or SIEM
Manager: A person who manages the whole SOC team

Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)
The CIRT team is comprised of forensics and threat intel experts, threat hunters, and malware analysts. All members work together to support SOC and respond to critical incidents.

If SOC expertise is not enough or the incident goes out of control, you urgently call the "firefighters" - CIRT, also called CSIRT or CERT. The members should have a broad knowledge of cyber threats and handle breaches without depending on tools like EDR or SIEM. A CIRT job is stressful and responsible, but also rewarding. Here are a few CIRT examples:

JPCERT: Japan's CERT handling nation-wide breaches
Mandiant: A private team responding to global cyber incidents
AWS CIRT: Investigates security incidents of AWS customers

Specialized Defensive Roles
A list of specialized security roles in bigger companies: DevSecOps, Penetration Tester, GRC Auditor, AppSec Engineer, Threat Analyst, AI Researcher.

Large companies, technology-focused startups, and government agencies often require narrow and specialized Blue Team roles - exciting and highly valuable, but requiring deep topic knowledge and broad experience in broader fields like SOC or IT. These narrow roles can include:

Digital Forensics Analyst: Uncover hidden threats in disk and memory
Threat Intelligence Analyst: Gather data about emerging threat groups
AppSec Engineer: Maintain a secure software development lifecycle
AI Researcher: Study AI threats and how to defend against them
tarting as a SOC L1 analyst may be a great option to broaden your cyber world awareness and better understand the more specialized roles. Moreover, even the entry-level SOC L1 role can be fun and engaging: You will deal with real attacks, protect the company from advanced threat groups, and learn a lot during the process. Let's see how you can start:

Gain core SOC skills and practice them. Related skills like red teaming or general IT would help, too!
Be proactive, try yourself in CTFs, stay in the loop of cyber news, and consider the SAL1 certification!
Prepare for an interview, learn the difference between an internal SOC and MSSP, and apply for a job!
After working for some time in a junior position, consider preparing and advancing to more senior roles!
Internal SOC vs MSSP
Not every organization has the expertise to operate a SOC on its own and relies on a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP), a company that delivers outsourced security services, most commonly SOC, to its clients. Working at MSSP is typically high-pressure, but it is also a good option to quickstart your career. While we recommend applying for any open SOC position as your first job, it's also important to understand the differences:

Topic	Internal SOC	MSSP
Scenario
Example	You work in a SOC team of the bank and protect the bank's systems	You work for a global MSSP protecting its sixty customers in Europe
Working
Pace	You usually have calm shifts without too much time pressure	Your shift usually starts from a queue of urgent alerts to analyze
Security
Tools	You work with just a few tools, but need to know them very well	You have to work with sixty diverse security tools and platforms
Incident
Practice
You saw and learned from just two major cyber attacks last year	Every week, you deal with attacks and breaches, and can learn from it
Next Steps
Your most natural next step after L1 is to become a SOC L2 analyst, but you are free to choose another path! While handling a SIEM alert, you might notice that engineering work appeals to you more. During a cyber attack, you may be fascinated by CIRT actions. You may also find yourself well-suited as a manager and build your path to the CISO role. No matter what, your first year or two is to get real work experience, and to spend this time effectively, follow the tips below!
